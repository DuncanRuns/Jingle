Changes in v1.1.0:

- Ported the EyeSee projector from @draconix6's Julti plugin to a new Jingle plugin, and added as a default plugin
  - Find it in Plugins -> EyeSee
  - In simpler terms, this adds the commonly requested zoom window with a ruler that was present in Julti, without needing OBS
  - As with Julti, it may not work with certain hardware configurations, a warning is included in the plugin tab
- Add "Minimize Projector When Inactive" option for the OBS Projector
- Added customizable borderless position (right-click the "Go Borderless" button)
- Some GUI tweaks/fixes

Changes in v1.0.0:

- Fix default cursor speed checkbox in Resizing customization script
- Better crash message for when trying to use as a fabric mod lol
- Rework OBS Link Script
    - Window capture support through secondary regenerate button
    - New name for mc capture
    - Regenerate button can now add missing mc capture
    - Julti support is now done by doing the following upon pressing either regenerate button:
        - Disable Julti source in Playing/Walling if it exists
        - Add Sound scene into Playing/Walling if it exists
        - Disable Minecraft Audio 1 in Sound scene if it exists
    - "Minecraft Capture 1" will also be disabled to not break with the previous Jingle format
- ðŸŽ‰

Changes in v0.3.0:

- Added a "Safe Reset" key to the Misc script
    - Allows setting a key which won't reset the world when chat is open or any menus
        - Reset <20s also follows these rules
- Measuring projector will now also close when disabling the option in the OBS tab
- Bigly OBS Link Script updates
    - Added a "Fix Julti Game Cap" which will unbound, center align, and reset the scale of the Minecraft Capture from
      the Julti scene
        - I will probably remove this after like a year once SQ is available for more versions and there's no reason to
          have Julti styled scenes
