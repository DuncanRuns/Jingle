# Jingle

An all-inclusive Minecraft speedrunning application written in **J**ava for a s**ingle** instance of Minecraft (As opposed to Julti which is written for M**ulti**).

## Developing

Jingle GUIs are made with the IntelliJ IDEA form designer, if you intend on changing GUI portions of the code, IntelliJ IDEA must be configured in a certain way to ensure the GUI form works properly:
- `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Build Tools` -> `Gradle` -> `Build and run using: IntelliJ Idea`
- `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `GUI Designer` -> `Generate GUI into: Java source code`
